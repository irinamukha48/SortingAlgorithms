# Sorting Algorithms
This is a graphic Java implementation of some of the sorting algorithms.
This includes:
- Bubble Sort
- Cocktail Shaker Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Counting Sort (non-Graphic)

It takes in how many values you want to sort out and the maximum value an element in the data array can be.
For example, if you entered "100", "100" (AS STRINGS) in the command line, it will create a 100 random values between 1 and 100 and sort them out on the screen.
Each value is represented as a rectangle (except for the counting sort).
To change the speed of the sorting, you would have to go into the code and change the value inside all of the pause() methods to the value you want (the higher -> the slower).
